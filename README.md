# hello-world
This is my first GitHub repository as part of the Data Scientist's Toolkit

I have been doing Business Intelligence design, programming and implmentation for the past 10 years with 3 different
organizations and their clients using a variety of tools such as Business Objects, Hyperion, SSAS, Oracle Report Writer and 
Tableau.

Looking forward to working in R and Git on a couple of projects that have been rolling around in my mind for a few years now.
